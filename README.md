# Text Discombobulator
This was the first thing I made to learn JavaScript. I learned in elementary school that if you take a word and change all the letters around, leaving only the first and last letter in the correct location, the text is still perfectly readable. Some people (particularly those with dyslexia or similar conditions) find it more readable than normal text. Added to this page is the option to add blue overlay to text, which helps some people with reading disabilities read text better. I made this page, in part, for my girlfriend who struggles with reading long text segments due to a dyslexia-like condition.
